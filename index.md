Hi and welcome to my site!

I graduated from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg), and am currently working as a Research Engineer at [NetVirta](https://www.netvirta.com/).

If you want to see what work I've done (or what I've been working on), check out my [projects](/projects).

Otherwise, you can check out my [posts](/posts), or whatever other miscellaneous thing I'm up to in [Others](/others).

I'm not super used to how Jekyll works though, so there might be issues here and there. Feel free to contact me if you spot anything!
