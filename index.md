Hello!

I am currently a PhD student at the [Computational Design Lab](https://cdl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich, under the supervision of [Prof. Bernd Bickel](http://berndbickel.com/about-me).

My research is currently in the intersection of acoustics and computational fabrication, where I seek to design objects that are visually interesting whilst still maintaining certain acoustical properties.

Before moving to Zürich, I spent about a year as a PhD student at the [Institute of Science and Technology, Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) where I was also under the supervision of Prof. Bernd.

Previously, I graduated from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg), and was working as a Research Engineer for 1 year at [NetVirta](https://www.netvirta.com/).

If you want to see what work I've done, check out my [projects](/projects).
