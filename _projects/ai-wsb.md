My team's project for SUTD's **50.017: Artificial Intelligence**, which is a course that introduces students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence.

The project explores how sentiments on Reddit's [r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) might affect the price movements of the BANG stocks in the market. We also built a simple [website](https://wsbets-5a075.web.app/) which offers a graphical view of our results and model. *(The website is no longer maintained and may not work properly)*

The project's Github page can be found [here](https://github.com/Mickey1356/sutd-ai-project), which contains links to the code, as well as our [report](https://github.com/Mickey1356/sutd-ai-project/blob/main/Report.pdf).

The general architecture of our pipeline is visualised below.
