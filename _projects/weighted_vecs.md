An undergraduate research project to explore how to speed up similarity searches using hashing algorithms.

We developed a general framework that can be used to augment discrete locality sensitive hashing schemes in order to produce more accurate similarity estimates, without sacrificing much in terms of computational time.

A preprint version of the paper can be found [here](/assets/papers/control-variates.pdf). The paper was published in the 4th Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision.
