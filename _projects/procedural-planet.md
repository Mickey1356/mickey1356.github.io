My project for SUTD's **50.017: Graphics and Visualisation**, which is an introductory course to computer graphics.

I built a procedural planet generator that produces realistic looking planets together with atmospheric scattering and voluminous clouds. It is written entirely in C++, and the project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Mickey1356/procedural-planet).

You can watch a short demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRheH01vBs).

Here are some more renders!
